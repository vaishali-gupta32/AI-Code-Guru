❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){ return a+b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ `a` and `b` are not defined within the function's scope. This will likely result in an error (ReferenceError: a is
not defined) when the function is executed, as JavaScript will try to access variables that don't exist in the current
scope or its parent scopes.
* ❌ The function doesn't accept any arguments, making it inflexible. It can only sum `a` and `b` if those variables are
available in the scope where the function is defined, which is bad practice.
* ❌ The function lacks documentation, making it unclear what it's supposed to do and how to use it.

✅ Recommended Fix:
```javascript
/**
* Sums two numbers.
* @param {number} a - The first number.
* @param {number} b - The second number.
* @returns {number} The sum of a and b.
*/
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔ **Arguments:** The function now accepts two arguments, `a` and `b`, making it reusable with different values.
* ✔ **Scope:** The variables `a` and `b` are now parameters, so they are properly defined within the function's scope.
* ✔ **Documentation:** JSDoc-style comments have been added to explain the function's purpose, parameters, and return
value.
* ✔ **Explicit Return:** It's now clear what the function returns, which is the sum of `a` and `b`.
